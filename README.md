# Housing_Price_Prediction: Project Overview

* Created a tool that estimates the sale price of a house (RMSE ~ $21K) to help homeowners better understand the value of their homes.
* Dataset is from the AMES Housing Dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
* Did some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the dataset.
* Engineered features to removed outliers, deal with categorical and missing data.
* Optimized Elastic Net using GridsearchCV for the best model.
